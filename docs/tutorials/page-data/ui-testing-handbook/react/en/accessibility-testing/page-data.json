When you improve accessibility, it has an outsized impact on your current and future customers. It’s also a legal requirement.</p>\n<p>The most accurate way to check accessibility is manually on real devices. But that requires specialized expertise and a lot of time, both of which are scarce on frontend teams.</p>\n<p>That's why many companies now use a combination of automated and manual testing. Automation catches common accessibility issues with low effort from developers. Manual QA is reserved for trickier problems that require human attention.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of resources that dive deep into accessibility principles, so we won't get into that here. Instead, we'll focus on how to automate accessibility testing with Storybook. It's a pragmatic approach to finding and fixing most issues you're likely to encounter.</p>\n<h2>Why automation?</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, let’s examine common types of disabilities: visual, hearing, mobility, cognition, speech, and neurological. These user disabilities yield app requirements like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>⌨ Keyboard navigation</li>\n<li>🗣 Screen reader support</li>\n<li>👆 Touch-friendly</li>\n<li>🎨 High enough colour contrast</li>\n<li>⚡️ Reduced motion</li>\n<li>🔍 Zoom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the past, you’d verify each of these requirements by checking every component across a combination of browsers, devices, and screen readers. But that’s impractical to do by hand because apps have dozens of components and are constantly updating the UI.</p>\n<h2>Automation speeds up your workflow</h2>\n<p>Automated tools audit the rendered DOM against a set of heuristics based on <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a> rules and other industry-accepted best practices. They act as the first line of QA to catch blatant accessibility violations.</p>\n<p>For example, Axe, on average, finds <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/blog/automated-testing-study-identifies-57-percent-of-digital-accessibility-issues/\">57% of WCAG issues automatically</a>. That allows teams to focus their expert resources on the more complex issues that require manual review.</p>\n<p>Many teams use the <a href=\"https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core\">Axe library</a> because it integrates with most existing test environments. For example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste\">Twilio Paste</a> team uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/twilio-labs/paste/blob/cd0ddad508e41cb9982a693a5160f1b7866f4e2a/packages/paste-core/components/checkbox/__tests__/checkboxdisclaimer.test.tsx#L40\">jest-axe integration</a>. Whereas the Shopify Polaris &#x26; Adobe Spectrum teams use the <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-a11y\">Storybook addon</a> version.</p>\n<p>The Storybook addon runs checks in the browser (as opposed to jsdom for Jest) and can therefore catch issues such as low contrast. However, it does require you to manually verify each story.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility testing workflow</h2>\n<p>By running these checks throughout the development process, you shorten the feedback loop and fix issues faster. Here’s what the workflow looks like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>👨🏽‍💻 <strong>During development:</strong> use Storybook to focus on one component at a time. Use the A11y addon to simulate vision defects and run an accessibility audit at the component level.</li>\n<li>✅ <strong>For QA:</strong> integrate the Axe audit into your functional testing pipeline. Run checks on all components to catch regressions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook/a11y-workflow.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Let’s see this workflow in action.</p>\n<h3>Install the accessibility addon</h3>\n<p>Storybook’s Accessibility runs Axe on the active story.

To catch such regressions, you'll want to test all your stories before opening a pull request. However, the Accessibility addon only runs checks when you’re viewing a story. To test all stories at once we can use the Storybook test runner. It’s a standalone utility (powered by <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> and <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a>) that checks for rendering errors in stories.</p>\n<p>Let’s go ahead and configure the test runner to run Axe.

We're using those hooks to inject Axe into a story, and then once it renders, run the accessibility test.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice a few options passed into the <code>checkA11y</code> function. We’ve set up Axe to start at the story's root element and then traverse down the DOM tree to check for issues. It will also generate a detailed report based on the issues it encountered and output a list of HTML elements that violated accessibility rules.</p>\n<p>To run the tests, start your Storybook in one terminal window with <code>yarn storybook</code> and the test runner in another with <code>yarn test-storybook</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook/test-runner-ally.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2>Catching integration issues</h2>\n<p>UIs are assembled by composing components and wiring them up to data and APIs.
