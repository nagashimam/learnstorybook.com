This chapter dives into what characteristics of UI components warrant testing and potential pitfalls to avoid. We researched professional teams at Wave, BBC, and Salesforce to land on a test strategy that balances comprehensive coverage, straightforward setup, and low maintenance.</p>\n<img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/ui-component.png\" width=\"250\">\n<h2>Fundamentals of UI component testing</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, let’s figure out what makes sense to test. Design systems are composed of UI components. Each UI component includes stories (permutations) that describe the intended look and feel given a set of inputs (props). Stories are then rendered by a browser or device for the end-user.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/component-test-cases.png\" alt=\"Component states are combinatorial\"></p>\n<p>Whoa! As you can see, one component contains many states. Multiply the states by the number of design system components, and you can see why keeping track of them all is a Sisyphean task. In reality, it’s unsustainable to review each experience by hand, especially as the design system grows.</p>\n<p>All the more reason to set up automated testing <strong>now</strong> to save work in the <strong>future</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Prepare to test</h2>\n<p>I surveyed 4 frontend teams about professional Storybook workflows in a <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/blog/the-delightful-storybook-workflow\">previous article</a>. They agreed on these best practices for writing stories to make testing easy and comprehensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Articulate supported component states</strong> as stories to clarify which combinations of inputs yield a given state. Ruthlessly omit unsupported states to reduce noise.</p>\n<p><strong>Render components consistently</strong> to mitigate variability that can be triggered by randomized (Math.random()) or relative (Date.now()) inputs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The best kind of stories allow you to visualize all of the states your component could experience in the wild” – Tim Hingston, Tech lead at Apollo GraphQL</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Visual test appearance</h2>\n<p>Design systems contain presentational UI components, which are inherently visual. Visual tests validate the visual aspects of the rendered UI.</p>\n<p>Visual tests capture an image of every UI component in a consistent browser environment. New screenshots are automatically compared to previously accepted baseline screenshots. When there are visual differences, you get notified.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/component-visual-testing.gif\" alt=\"Visual test components\"></p>\n<p>If you’re building a modern UI, visual testing saves your frontend team from time-consuming manual review and prevents expensive UI regressions.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/#publish-storybook\">previous chapter</a> we learned how to publish Storybook using <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website&#x26;utm_medium=link&#x26;utm_campaign=storybook\">Chromatic</a>. We added a bold red border around each <code>Button</code> component and then requested feedback from teammates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-button-border-change.png\" alt=\"Button red border\"></p>\n<p>Now let's see how visual testing works using Chromatic's built-in <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/features/test/?utm_source=storybook_website&#x26;utm_medium=link&#x26;utm_campaign=storybook\">testing tools</a>. When we created the pull request, Chromatic captured images for our changes and compared them to previous versions of the same components. Four changes were found:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-list-of-checks.png\" alt=\"List of checks in the pull request\"></p>\n<p>Click the <strong>🟡 UI Tests</strong> check to review them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-second-build-from-pr.png\" alt=\"Second build in Chromatic with changes\"></p>\n<p>Review them to confirm whether they’re intentional (improvements) or unintentional (bugs). If you accept the changes, the test baselines will be updated. That means subsequent commits will be compared to the new baselines to detect bugs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-review-changes-pr.png\" alt=\"Reviewing changes in Chromatic\"></p>\n<p>In the last chapter, our teammate did not want a red border around the <code>Button</code>'s for some reason. Deny the changes to indicate that they need to be undone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-review-deny.png\" alt=\"Review deny in Chromatic\"></p>\n<p>Undo the changes and commit again to pass your visual tests again.</p>\n<h2>Interaction tests</h2>\n<p>So far, we've seen how visual testing enabled us to spot-check appearance and catch UI regressions. But as we continue to develop our design system, our components will eventually become responsible for more than just rendering the UI. At some point, they'll handle state management or even fetch data. That's where testing component interactions will help us.</p>\n<p>Interaction testing is a well-known pattern for verifying user behavior. You start by providing mocked data to set up your test, simulate user interactions with a testing library, and verify the UI changes. In Storybook, this happens in the browser, making it easier to debug failures because you're running tests in the same environment as you develop components: the browser.</p>\n<p>To enable it, we're going to rely on Storybook's <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function\"><code>play</code></a> function and instrumented testing libraries to set up our tests and then use the <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner\">test-runner</a> to verify that our component renders correctly.</p>\n<h3>Setup the test runner</h3>\n<p>Start by adding the necessary dependencies with:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`yarn add --dev @storybook/jest @storybook/test-runner`, `68577253934542840000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"68577253934542840000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">yarn add --dev @storybook/jest @storybook/test-runner\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, add a new test task to your <code>package.json</code> scripts:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test-storybook\": \"test-storybook\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Write an interaction test using the play function</h3>\n<p>Interaction tests are centered around how the UI handles user actions, either using the keyboard, mouse, or other input devices and checking whether UI visual elements are displayed and working correctly. Testing libraries like <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> provide helpful APIs for simulating human interactions and verifying the UI state. We'll use instrumented versions of these tools to write our tests. Therefore, maintaining a common syntax, but with additional telemetry to help us debug.</p>\n<p>The test itself is defined inside a <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function\"><code>play</code></a> function connected to a story. They're small snippets of code that run after the story renders.</p>\n<p>Let's see how it works by updating the <code>Button</code> story and set up our first interaction test by adding the following:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`import styled from '@emotion/styled';\n\nimport { Button } from './Button';\nimport { Icon } from '../Icon/Icon';\nimport { StoryLinkWrapper } from '../LinkWrapper';\n\n import { userEvent, within } from '@storybook/testing-library';\n import { expect } from '@storybook/jest';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Design System/Button',\n  component: Button,\n};\n\n// Other Button stories\n\n/*\n * New story using the play function.\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function\n * to learn more about the play function.\n */\n export const WithInteractions = {\n   args: {\n     appearance: 'primary',\n     href: 'http://storybook.js.org',\n     ButtonWrapper: StoryLinkWrapper,\n     children: 'Button',\n   },\n   play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n     // Assigns canvas to the component root element\n     const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n     await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('link'));\n     expect(canvas.getByRole('link')).toHaveAttribute(\n       'href',\n       'http://storybook.js.org',\n     );\n   },\n };`, `43887278106370210000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"43887278106370210000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">src/Button/Button.stories.jsx</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-diff\">import styled from '@emotion/styled';\n\nimport { Button } from './Button';\nimport { Icon } from '../Icon/Icon';\nimport { StoryLinkWrapper } from '../LinkWrapper';\n\n+ import { userEvent, within } from '@storybook/testing-library';\n+ import { expect } from '@storybook/jest';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Design System/Button',\n  component: Button,\n};\n\n// Other Button stories\n\n/*\n * New story using the play function.\n * See https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/play-function\n * to learn more about the play function.\n */\n+ export const WithInteractions = {\n+   args: {\n+     appearance: 'primary',\n+     href: 'http://storybook.js.org',\n+     ButtonWrapper: StoryLinkWrapper,\n+     children: 'Button',\n+   },\n+   play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {\n+     // Assigns canvas to the component root element\n+     const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n+     await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('link'));\n+     expect(canvas.getByRole('link')).toHaveAttribute(\n+       'href',\n+       'http://storybook.js.org',\n+     );\n+   },\n+ };\n</code></pre>\n<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>\n  <source\n    src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/dsd-storybook-interaction-testing-with-play-function-7-0.mp4\"\n    type=\"video/mp4\"\n  />\n</video>\n<p>When Storybook finishes rendering the story, it executes the steps defined inside the <code>play</code> function, interacting with the component, similar to how a user would do it. Click the <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing#interactive-debugger\"><code>Interactions</code></a> panel. You'll see a detailed execution flow while also providing a convenient set of UI controls to pause, resume, rewind, and step through each interaction.</p>\n<h3>Automate tests with the test runner</h3>\n<p>We've seen how interaction tests with the <code>play</code> function helped us verify how a component responds when we interact with it. But as design systems evolve, manually verifying every change can quickly become unrealistic. Storybook test runner automates this process. It's a standalone utility—powered by <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a>—that runs parallel to your Storybook, executing all interaction tests and catching broken stories.</p>\n<p>With Storybook running, open a new terminal window and run the test runner with:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`yarn test-storybook --watch`, `34628826726301676000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"34628826726301676000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">yarn test-storybook --watch\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/test-runner-execution.png\" alt=\"Storybook test runner execution\"></p>\n<p>It will verify whether all our stories render without errors and that all assertions pass automatically during execution. What's more, if a test fails, it will provide us with a link that opens up the failing story in the browser.</p>\n<h3>Run interaction tests in CI</h3>\n<p>Interaction tests with the <code>play</code> function and automation with the test runner helped us simulate user interactions and verify the UI state of our components. However, running them locally can be a time-consuming and repetitive task, even as our design system continues to grow. Once again, that's where CI comes in. Let's see how to set it up with our existing CI workflow.</p>\n<p>Update the existing workflow that we created in the <a href=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/#chromatic-ci\">previous chapter</a> and enable interaction testing as follows:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`# Name of our action\nname: 'Chromatic'\n# The event that will trigger the action\non: push\n\n# What the action will do\njobs:\n  # Run interaction tests\n  interaction-tests:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: yarn\n      - name: Install Playwright\n        run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n      - name: Build Storybook\n        run: yarn build-storybook --quiet\n      - name: Serve Storybook and run tests\n        run: |\n          npx concurrently -k -s first -n &quot;SB,TEST&quot; -c &quot;magenta,blue&quot; \\\n            &quot;npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent&quot; \\\n            &quot;npx wait-on tcp:6006 && yarn test-storybook&quot;\n  visual-tests:\n    # The operating system it will run on\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # The list of steps that the action will go through\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          #👇 Fetches all history so Chromatic can compare against previous builds\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - run: yarn\n        #👇 Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow\n      - uses: chromaui/action@v1\n        # Options required for Chromatic's GitHub Action\n        with:\n          #👇 Chromatic projectToken, see https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/ to obtain it\n          projectToken: \\${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}\n          token: \\${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, `20477343936308160000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"20477343936308160000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">.github/workflows/chromatic.yml</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># Name of our action\nname: 'Chromatic'\n# The event that will trigger the action\non: push\n\n# What the action will do\njobs:\n  # Run interaction tests\n  interaction-tests:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: yarn\n      - name: Install Playwright\n        run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n      - name: Build Storybook\n        run: yarn build-storybook --quiet\n      - name: Serve Storybook and run tests\n        run: |\n          npx concurrently -k -s first -n \"SB,TEST\" -c \"magenta,blue\" \\\n            \"npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent\" \\\n            \"npx wait-on tcp:6006 &#x26;&#x26; yarn test-storybook\"\n  visual-tests:\n    # The operating system it will run on\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # The list of steps that the action will go through\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          #👇 Fetches all history so Chromatic can compare against previous builds\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - run: yarn\n        #👇 Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow\n      - uses: chromaui/action@v1\n        # Options required for Chromatic's GitHub Action\n        with:\n          #👇 Chromatic projectToken, see https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/ to obtain it\n          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our workflow will run when code is pushed to any branch of our design system repository, and it will have two jobs; one for interaction tests and one for visual tests. The interaction test job starts by building Storybook and then\nruns the test runner, notifying us of broken tests. The visual test job will function as before, running Chromatic to verify the visual state of our components.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility test</h2>\n<p>“Accessibility means all people, including those with disabilities, can understand, navigate, and interact with your app... Online [examples include] alternative ways to access content such as using the tab key and a screen reader to traverse a site.” writes developer <a href=\"https://medium.com/storybookjs/instant-accessibility-qa-linting-in-storybook-4a474b0f5347\">Alex Wilson from T.Rowe Price</a>.</p>\n<p>Disabilities affect 15% of the population, according to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/\">World Health Organization</a>.

Be judicious about testing the right things – not everything. Even though software development has many test strategies, we discovered the hard way that some aren’t suited for design systems.</p>\n<h3>Code coverage tests</h3>\n<p>Code coverage tests measure how much of your codebase is covered by tests. They're a good way to ensure that your tests are actually testing something. However, they're not a good way to measure the quality of your tests, but they can be beneficial to verify that all the components and utilities provided by the design system are functioning as expected, helping to identify any potential gaps or issues in the design system's implementation. Storybook provides an <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-coverage/\">addon</a> to help us with this. Powered by <a href=\"https://istanbul.js.org/\">Istanbul</a>, the Storybook coverage addon generates a code coverage report for your Storybook stories. Let's see how.</p>\n<p>Start by running the following command to install the coverage addon:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-coverage`, `89500340504203080000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"89500340504203080000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-coverage\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, update your Storybook configuration to include the addon:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`/** @type { import('@storybook/react-vite').StorybookConfig } */\nconst config = {\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],\n  addons: [\n    '@storybook/addon-links',\n    '@storybook/addon-essentials',\n    '@storybook/addon-interactions',\n    '@storybook/addon-a11y',\n   '@storybook/addon-coverage',\n  ],\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/react-vite',\n    options: {},\n  },\n  docs: {\n    autodocs: 'tag',\n  },\n};\nexport default config;`, `82623446284878360000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"82623446284878360000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">.storybook/main.js</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-diff\">/** @type { import('@storybook/react-vite').StorybookConfig } */\nconst config = {\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],\n  addons: [\n    '@storybook/addon-links',\n    '@storybook/addon-essentials',\n    '@storybook/addon-interactions',\n    '@storybook/addon-a11y',\n+   '@storybook/addon-coverage',\n  ],\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/react-vite',\n    options: {},\n  },\n  docs: {\n    autodocs: 'tag',\n  },\n};\nexport default config;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, with Storybook running, start the test runner (in a separate terminal window) with the <code>--coverage</code> flag:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`yarn test-storybook --coverage`, `11162020733505296000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"11162020733505296000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-shell\">yarn test-storybook --coverage\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/test-runner-coverage-testing.png\" alt=\"Storybook coverage tests report\"></p>\n<p>From here, follow the recommendations to improve your code coverage.</p>\n<h4>Snapshot tests (Jest)</h4>\n<p>This technique captures the code output of UI components and compares it to previous versions. Testing UI component markup ends up testing implementation details (code), not what the user experiences in the browser.</p>\n<p>Diffing code snapshots are unpredictable and prone to false positives. At the component level, code snapshotting doesn’t account for global changes like design tokens, CSS, and 3rd party API updates (web fonts, Stripe forms, Google Maps, etc.). In practice, developers resort to “approving all” or ignoring snapshot tests altogether.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most component snapshot tests are really just a worse version of screenshot tests. Test your outputs. Snapshot what gets rendered, not the underlying (volatile!) markup. – Mark Dalgliesh, Frontend infrastructure at SEEK, CSS modules creator</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>End-to-end tests (Selenium, Cypress)</h4>\n<p>End-to-end tests traverse the component DOM to simulate the user flow. They’re best suited for verifying app flows like the signup or checkout process. The more complex functionality, the more useful this testing strategy is.</p>\n<p>Design systems contain atomic components with relatively simple functionality. Validating user flows is often overkill for this task because the tests are time-consuming to create and brittle to maintain. However, in rare situations, components may benefit from end-to-end tests. For instance, validating complex UIs like datepickers or self-contained payment forms.</p>\n<h2>Drive adoption with documentation</h2>\n<p>A design system is not complete with tests alone. Since design systems serve stakeholders from across the organization, we need to teach others how to get the most from our well-tested UI components.</p>\n<p>In chapter 6, we’ll learn how to accelerate design system adoption with documentation. See why Storybook Docs is a secret weapon to create comprehensive docs with less work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Test to maintain quality","description":"How to test design system appearance, functionality, and accessibility","commit":"5f69e5c"},"fields":{"guide":"design-systems-for-developers","slug":"/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/test/","chapter":"test","framework":"react","language":"en","permalink":"https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/test/","tutorialUpToDate":true}},"currentGuide":{"frontmatter":{"codeGithubUrl":"https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook-design-system","toc":["introduction","architecture","build","review","test","document","distribute","workflow","conclusion"],"title":"Design Systems for Developers","twitterShareText":"I’m learning about building design systems!
