This chapter covers techniques for gathering UI feedback and reaching a consensus with your team. These production processes are used by folks at Auth0, Shopify, and Discovery Network.</p>\n<h2>Single source of truth or single point of failure</h2>\n<p>Previously, I wrote that design systems are a <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/blog/why-design-systems-are-a-single-point-of-failure\">single point of failure</a> for frontend teams. In essence, design systems are a dependency. If you change a design system component, that change propagates to dependent apps. The mechanism for distributing changes is unbiased--it ships both improvements and bugs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/design-system-dependencies.png\" alt=\"Design system dependencies\"></p>\n<p>Bugs are an existential risk for design systems, so we’ll do everything to prevent them. Minor tweaks end up snowballing into innumerable regressions. Without an ongoing maintenance strategy, design systems wither.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“But it works on my machine?!” – everyone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Visual review UI components with your team</h2>\n<p>Visual review is the process of confirming the behavior and aesthetics of user interfaces. It happens both while you’re developing UI and during QA with the team.</p>\n<p>Most developers are familiar with code review, the process of gathering code feedback from other developers to improve code quality. Since UI components express code graphically, visual review is necessary to collect UI/UX feedback.</p>\n<h3>Establish a universal reference point</h3>\n<p>Delete node_modules. Reinstall packages. Clear localstorage. Delete cookies. If these actions sound familiar, you know how tough it is to ensure teammates reference the latest code. When folks don’t have identical dev environments, it’s a nightmare to discern issues caused by the local environment from actual bugs.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, as frontend developers, we have a common compile target: the browser. Savvy teams publish their Storybook online to serve as a universal reference point for visual review, sidestepping the inherent complications of local dev environments (it’s annoying to be tech support anyways).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/design-system-visual-review.jpg\" alt=\"Review your work in the cloud\"></p>\n<p>When living UI components are accessible via a URL, stakeholders can confirm UI look and feel from the comfort of their browsers. That means developers, designers, and PMs don’t have to fuss with a local development environment, pass screenshots around, or reference outdated UIs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Deploying Storybook each PR makes visual review easier and helps product owners think in components.\" –Norbert de Langen, Storybook core maintainer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"publish-storybook\">Publish Storybook</h2>\n<p>We will demonstrate a visual review workflow with <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website&#x26;utm_medium=link&#x26;utm_campaign=storybook\">Chromatic</a>, a free publishing service made by the Storybook maintainers. This allows you to deploy and host your Storybook safely and securely in the cloud, but it's also pretty straightforward to <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/publish-storybook\">build Storybook as a static site and deploy</a> it to other hosting services as well.</p>\n<h3>Get Chromatic</h3>\n<p>First, go to <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/?utm_source=storybook_website&#x26;utm_medium=link&#x26;utm_campaign=storybook\">chromatic.com</a> and sign up with your GitHub account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/chromatic-signup.png\" alt=\"Signing up at Chromatic\"></p>\n<p>From there, choose your design system repo.

Now that you set up the infrastructure to publish Storybook let's improve it with continuous integration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chromatic-ci\">Continuous integration</h3>\n<p>Continuous integration is the defacto way to maintain modern web apps. It allows you to script behavior like tests, analysis, and deployment whenever you push code. We’ll borrow this technique to save ourselves from repetitive manual work.</p>\n<p>We'll use GitHub Actions, which is free for our modest usage. The same principles apply to other CI services as well.</p>\n<p>Add a <code>.github</code> directory at the top level. Then create another directory called <code>workflows</code>.</p>\n<p>Create a file called chromatic.yml like the one below. It will allow us to script how our CI process behaves. We'll start small for now and continue to improve it as we progress:</p>\n<div\n              class=\"gatsby-code-button-container\"\n              onClick=\"copyToClipboard(`# Name of our action\nname: 'Chromatic'\n# The event that will trigger the action\non: push\n\n# What the action will do\njobs:\n  test:\n    # The operating system it will run on\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # The list of steps that the action will go through\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          #👇 Fetches all history so Chromatic can compare against previous builds\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - run: yarn\n        #👇 Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow\n      - uses: chromaui/action@v1\n        # Options required for Chromatic's GitHub Action\n        with:\n          #👇 Chromatic projectToken, see https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/ to obtain it\n          projectToken: \\${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}\n          token: \\${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, `51074754798905000000`)\"\n            >\n              <div\n                class=\"gatsby-code-button\"\n                data-toaster-id=\"51074754798905000000\"\n              >\n                Copy \n              </div>\n            </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-code-title\">.github/workflows/chromatic.yml</div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># Name of our action\nname: 'Chromatic'\n# The event that will trigger the action\non: push\n\n# What the action will do\njobs:\n  test:\n    # The operating system it will run on\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # The list of steps that the action will go through\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          #👇 Fetches all history so Chromatic can compare against previous builds\n          fetch-depth: 0\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          #👇 Sets the version of Node.js to use\n          node-version: 16\n      - run: yarn\n        #👇 Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow\n      - uses: chromaui/action@v1\n        # Options required for Chromatic's GitHub Action\n        with:\n          #👇 Chromatic projectToken, see https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/review/ to obtain it\n          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"aside\"><p>💡 For brevity purposes <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets\">GitHub secrets</a> weren't mentioned.
